# Linux-dotfiles :penguin:
Hello and welcome, this are my personal dot files. You can find a variety of scripts as well to get a (mostly) full desktop experience using Qtile, Hyprland and/or i3 (although this should work for any WM).

Mind you this is still a WIP, so feel free to make suggestions, I'm always looking to learn a bit more about Linux.
